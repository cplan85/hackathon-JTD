[Back-End Repo](https://github.com/nillozama/HackatonPersonas65)

The main navigation format is based on an interactive 3D cube, and each face of the cube represents important datapoints.


## :memo: **What do we still need to do**

1. Login Administration of different users.

2. Dynamic Filtering of different data points. 

3. Sidebar Statistics representation in dynamic charts.

4. Design and style the app.
